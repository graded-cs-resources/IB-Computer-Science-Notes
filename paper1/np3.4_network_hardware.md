# Networking Hardware

The IB exam expects you to have a general understanding of different types of hardware used in networks. This includes:

* Types of transmission media
  * Metal conductor cables
  * Fiber optic cables
  * Wireless transmissions using radio waves
* Hardware used in wired networking
  * ethernet adapters
  * hubs
  * switches
  * routers
* Harware used in wireless networking
  * wireless network adapters
  * wireless access points
  * wireless routers    

## Transmission Media

### Metal conductor cables

There are several types of metal wires that are used to transmit networking information. If you get your internet from a cable company, you are connected using a *coaxial cable*, a type of metal wire. Ethernet cables used to connect to routers and switches with wired connection are also metal on the inside. 

Metal wire is cheap, flexible, and fairly fast, but if used over very long distances data can be lost.

### Fiber Optic Cables

These cables use very fast beams of light traveling through glass. They are significantly more expensive and more difficult to use than metal conductor cable, but they are also very very fast.

Currently, fiber optic cables are mostly used between large internet hubs to carry huge amounts of information quickly. It is more and more common to find internet service providers that will provide fiber optic connection all the way to end users, resulting in faster (but more expensive) internet.
