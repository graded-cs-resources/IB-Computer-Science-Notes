# Resource Management and the computer Operating System

**Note:** This is an HL ONLY topic. 

As we've seen in previous notes, even a simple computer has many different resources that need to be used in an efficient way to make the computer work as well as possible. We call this process *resource management*.

* [RAM](np1.2_memory.md)
* [Cache](np1.2_memory.md)
* [Processor operations / speed](np1.3_architecture.md)
* Internet or Network bandwidth (Topic 3 of the IB!)
* Graphics processor speed
* Screen resolution (how much can fit on your screen)
* [Storage space / secondary memory](np1.2_memory.md)
* Input and output device bandwidth

Like all "thinking" that happens in your computer, this is managed primarily by the Control Unit, but, of course, the Control Unit only does what it is told to do by software.
