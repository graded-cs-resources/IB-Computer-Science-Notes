# Graded IB Computer Science Notes Page

This page will store notes made by Mr. Griswold for students in IB Computer Science. It will be updated and edited over time, but old versions will be archived.

### [See the version of these notes used from 2019-2020](./2019/index.md)

The table of contents below is broken into three sections - general course resources, Programming Notes, and Non-Programming Notes. A significant portion of this class will be devoted to learning to program computers in java, and we will use the website CodeHS.ccom to help us with that. However, in each unit we will also cover at least a little non-programming content, which will be in its own section. 

# Table of Contents

## Paper 1 Notes 

These notes cover content not included in CS Awesome, because they are not about programming. They are organized by IB topic, which may not be the order we learn about them. Not every topic we learn has corresponding notes here - for some sections, we will use external resources.
  
### IB Topic 2 - Computer Organization

* [P1 2.1 - Abstraction and the Elements of a Computer System](./paper1/np2.1_abstraction.md) (IB Topic 2)

* [P1 2.2 - Memory and Storage](./paper1/np2.2_memory.md) (IB Topic 2)

* [P1 2.3 - Computer Processor Architecture](./paper1/np2.3_architecture.md) (IB topic 2)

* [P1 2.4 - Software, the OS, and Programming languages](./paper1/np2.4_software.md) (IB Topic 2)

* [P1 2.5 - Working with Binary and Hexadecimal](paper1/np2.5_representing_integers.md)

* [P1 2.6 - Representing characters on computers](paper1/np2.6_representing_characters.md)

* [P1 2.7 - Representing other numbers](paper1/np2.7_representing_other_numbers.md)

* [P1 2.8 - Representing colors](paper1/np2.8_representing_colors.md)

* [P1 2.9 - Logic gates and circuits](paper1/np2.9_boolean_logic.md)

### IB Topic 4 - Programmatic Thinking and Pseudocode

* [P1 4.3 - IB collections](paper1/np4.3_collections.md)

* [P1 4.4 - IB Arrays](paper1/np4.4_arrays.md)

* [P1 4.5 - Search Algorithms](paper1/np4.5_searching_data_structures.md)
  
* [P1 4.10 - Common Pseudocode Techniques](paper1/np4.10_common_pseudocode.md)

### IB Topic 7 - HL ONLY - Control

* [P1 7.1 - Introducing Control](paper1/np7.1_introducing_control_systems.md)

## Paper 2 - Java Programming Notes

These notes will be correlated with the programming we are doing in CS Awesome and will occasionally expand upon them to be a better fit for the IB. 

### Unit 1

* [P2 1.2 - Printing in Java](./programming/p1.2_printing.md)

* [P2 1.3 - Variables and data types](./programming/p1.3_variables.md)

* [P2 1.4 and 1.5 - Operators and Assignment](./programming/p1.4_operators.md)

* [P2 1.6 - User Input](./programming/p1.6_userinput.md)

* [P2 1.7 - Casting](./programming/p1.7_casting.md)

### Unit 2

* [P2 2.1 - Introducing Objects](./programming/p2.1_introducing_objects.md)
  
* [P2 2.1a - Object Anatomy Practice](./programming/p2.1a_object_anatomy_practice.md)

* [P2 2.2 - UML Class Diagrams](./programming/p2.2_uml_class_diagrams.md)


## Course Resources

* [Official IB Syllabus](./resources/syllabus.md). In the notes, when a section connects directly to this syllabus, it will be represented with a superscript, like<sup>this</sup>.

* [CS Awesome](http://csawesome.runestone.academy). This is the primary online platform we will use to learn to program in Java.
  
* [Traced algorithms and coding problems](./resources/traced_algorithms.md). I will add coding problems and traced algorithms to this page, over time, for you to view and practice with.

* [CodingBat](https://codingbat.com/java). Coding practice in java

* [CodingBat Pseudocode Practice](https://graded-cs-resources.github.io/CodingBatPseudo/) - Coding practice in IB Pseudocode
  
* [IA Information](./resources/ia.md)

* [Sample IA Made in Class by Mr. G](./resources/sample_ia.md)

* [The IB CS Guide](https://ib.compscihub.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IBCompSciGuide.pdf) - Includes the full syllabus (as a PDF, rather than the website above) and IA guidelines among other things

* [CompSciHub About page](https://ib.compscihub.net/about) - This excellent resource put together by IB CS teachers and students compiles notes and information about the course.

* [Paul Baumgarten's IB CS Page](https://pbaumgarten.com/ib-compsci/) - Paul Baumgarten is a long-time IB CS teacher and active contributor to the community. His page includes notes and exercises on nearly all IB topics, as well as links to even more resources. The order is different than our course, but an excellent resource for studying or reading new perspectives.

* [Mr. Wach's IB CS Page](https://mrwachs.wordpress.com/current-classes/computer-science-i-b/) - Mr. Wachs is a teacher of many computer science courses including IB CS. He has many videos, slideshows, and workbooks that we will look at for some units, and makes a good resource for studying many aspects of the course.
