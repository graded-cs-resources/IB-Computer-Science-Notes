# Arithmetic Operators and Assignment

An **operator**:star:, in a programming language, is a tool used to modify, manipulate, or work with individual values or variables. It is almost always represented using some form of *word* or *symbol* put before, after, or between one or more variables, constants, or literals.

Modern programming languages have MANY operators. We will define the most important ones below - a lot of them will seem obvious, but having the reference could be valuable.

I have bolded the ones that might have something kind of surprising or that you might not have seen before - if you only read a few of them, read those!

## Operators on Numeric Values

### Arithmetic Operators

The operators you are most familar with: these do math.

The examples below represent the results from java. The final column shows the symbol used for this operator in IB Pseudocode (more on that later!)

| Operator                                       | Code Sample                                  | Result                                                 | IB    |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----- |
| Addition (`+`)                                 | `int a = 2;int b = 7;`<br>`a + b`           | <br>`9`                                                |`+`|   
| Subtraction (`-`)                              | `a - b`                                      | `-5`                                                   | `-`   |
| Multiplication (`*`)                           | `a * b`                                      | `14`                                                   | `*`   |
| **Integer Division (`/`)**                               | `a / b` <br> `b / a`                         | `0`<br>`3`                          | `div`   |
| **Modulus or Remainder (`%`)**                 | `a % b`<br>`b % a`                           | `2` (remainder of 2 / 7) <br> `1` (remainder of 7 / 2) | `mod` |
| Floating point division (`/`)          | `double a = 2.0, b = 7.0`;<br> `a / b` <br> `b / a` | <br>`0.285714285714`<br>`3.5`                                         | `/` |
    
The arithmetic operators follow the standard mathematical order of operations - multiplication, modulus, and division are evluated left-to-right first, addition and subtraction second, but parentheses can be used to overcome the order.

A common error comes if you try to divide (or modulus) by 0. Be careful to check to make sure you aren't doing that if you ever divide by a variable!

## Operators on Strings

**Concatenation** is the process of combining two strings into one longer string.

| Operator                     | Code Sample                                 | Result          | IB  |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------- | --- |
| **Concatenation (`+`)** <br> | `String b = "bob"`;<br>`b + " " + b + "mary";` | <br>bob bobmary | N/A |

There are many other thing 

**Note that since the same operator, `+` is used for strings and numbers, you can get some odd results if you aren't careful.**

```java
"a" + 3; // result: "a3" - converts 3 to a string then concatentes
3 + "a"; // result: "3a" - same as above
3 + 2 + "a" // result: "5a" - does 3 + 2 first, then concatenates with a
3 + (2 + "a") // result: 32a. Concatenates 2 and a to "2a" then concatenates the 3.
"a" + 3 + 2 // result: a32
"a" + (3 + 2) // result: a5
"a" + (3 - 2) // result: a1
"a" + 3 - 2 // error! tries to do "a3" - 2, which is not possible.
```

## Assignment Operators

These operators change the value stored inside a variable. By far the most important one is the first one; we will mostly avoid using the others, but they exist. Everything on the right will always be fully evaluated before assigning to the value to the left.

| Operator                                                                            | Code                     | Result                                 | Note                      | IB  |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | --- |
| Assignment (`=`)                                                                    | `a = 3;`<br>`a = a + 1;` | `a` has value 3<br>now `a` has value 4 |                           | `=` |
| **Increment (`++`**) <br>increases variable value by 1.<br>Used after OR before the variable. | `a = 3;`<br>`a++;`<br>`++a;`      | `a` has value 3<br>now `a` has value 4<br>now `a` has value 5| equivalent to `a = a + 1` | N/A |
| Decrement (`--`) <br>decreases variable value by 1.<br>Used before OR after the variable.     | `a = 3;`<br>`a--;`<br>`--a;`      | `a` has value 3<br>now `a` has value 2<br>now `a` has value 1 | equivalent to `a = a - 1` | N/A |
| Addition assignment (`+=`) <br> increases variable on left by amount on right.      | `a = 3;`<br>`a += 4;`    | `a` has value 3<br>now `a` has value 7 | equivalent to `a = a + 4` | N/A |

There are also versions of the last one for subtraction `-=`, division `/=`, and multiplication `*=`.

#### Point of care!

The increment and decrement operators (`++` and `--`) can be used before or after the variable, and as long as you use them on their own line, they are interchangeable. But if you try to combine them on a line with other things, weird things can happen!
 
```java
int a = 5;
int b = 5;

System.out.println(a++); //will print 5
System.out.println(a); // will print 6

System.out.println(++b); //will print 6
System.out.println(b); //will print 6
```

So what's going on here? Technically, the two uses of the operators work slightly differently. If you use it AFTER the value, it first *returns* the original value, THEN makes the variable larger/smaller, so if you try to print it you get the original value. If you use it BEFORE the variable, it increments/decrements it first, THEN returns it. Most people find the "before" behavior to be more intuitive, so maybe use that!
