# Making Decisions (if statements) and returning from a method

Many methods that you write in programming will need to make some sort of *decision* where they will do one thing in some situations, and a different thing in other situations.

In programming, we make decisions using an **if statement** also known as a **conditional statement**. Here is an example of how we can use an if statement in java to choose between several different options.

```java
/** Determines whether a student failed a test based on marks out of 100 */
public boolean didStudentFail(int marks) {
    if (marks < 55) {
        return true;
    } else {
        return false;
    }
}
```

The command **`return`** in this code represents the ANSWER that the method provides. Note the syntax - the parentheses `()`, curly brackets `{}`, and semi-colons `;` are all important to the correct functioning of this code.

if statements always follow the same format:

```java
if (/*test that results in true or false*/) {
    //code that only runs when the test is true
} else {
    //code that runs if the test is false (optional!)
}
```

You can stack multiple mutually exclusive if statements like so:

```java
/** returns A, B, C, or F based on marks out of 100*/
public String getGrade(int marks) {
    if (marks < 55) {
        return "F";
    } else if (marks < 70) {
        return "C";
    } else if (marks < 85) {
        return "B";
    } else {
        return "A";
    }
}

```

2.  Based on this code, what do you think a `String` is?

    <details markdown="1"><summary>Click to expand answer</summary>
    It is a word or letter, surrounded by quotation marks
    </details>

3.  If the student earns 82 marks, what will their grade be?

    <details markdown="1"><summary>Click to expand answer</summary>
    "B"
    </details>

4. Write a method called `sumOrZero` (including the full signature!) that will take two integers as parameters, and return their sum, UNLESS the two integers are the same, in which case it will return 0. Note that you can use the test `a == b` to check if two variables `a` and `b` are equal.

    ```java
    public int sumOrZero(int a, int b) {
        if (a == b) {
            return 0;
        }else {
            return a + b;
        }
    }
    ```
