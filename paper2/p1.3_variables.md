# Lesson 1.3 Summary and Expansion - Variables and Data Types

*These notes go into significantly more detail than the notes on CodeHS. Please make sure to review them thoroughly, as the CodeHS videos will not be sufficient for this topic.*

At the lowest level, all informaton (or data) on a computer is just a string of 0's and 1's. It is very important that a string of 0's or 1's will be interpreted correctly - does it represent a number? A word? A command?

One of the ways our computer programs know how to interpret data in the context of a programming language is by the **data type**:star: of the data, which is set in the program. This defines the specific type of information held in that piece of data.

In a program, there are three things that have types:

* **Variables**:star: are named locations in memory whose value may change over the course of the program.
* **Constants**:star: (or *finals*) are like variables in that they have a name, but their value will always be the same
* **Literals**:star: are individual elements like `2` or `"abc"` that are used only once and represent a value of a certain type directly.

## Variables

A variable is basically a name that refers to a spot in your computer's memory where you can hold data of a specific type. The value can be changed later.

In order to use a variable in java, you need to **declare**:star: the variable by typing first the type of the variable, then its name, then an OPTIONAL section where you set its initial value with an equals sign (called **initializing the variable**:star:). 

To make the variable a *constant*, so it cannot be changed, you use the keyword **final** first.

```java
int numApples;
// makes a new variable named numApples that can hold an integer.
// because it is not initialized, it will default to some built-in default value (probably 0)

final int numOranges = 6;
// makes a new variable called numOranges that can hold an integer.
// initializes the value to 6
// declares that we can't change it.

numApples = 5; // changes the already existing numApples value to 5
numOranges = 7; // ERROR! Can't change a final value.

int numApples = 9;
// ERROR! numApples already exists! Can't declare again with int.

numOranges = 1.3;
// ERROR! numOranges is an integer, and can't hold decimals.
```

### Variable names - rules and conventions

There are some rules when it comes to naming variables in java (most languages have similar rules)

* The first character in the name must be a letter, `$`, or `_`.

* the rest of the name can only be letters, numbers, or `_`

* words used elsewhere in the programming language are called *reserved words*, and also can't be used. This includes words like `int`, `public`, `class`, etc - words you see inside the program itself. You will get an error if you accidentally try to use a reserved word - just change the name in that case.

There are also some *conventions* that we usually follow when naming a variable. These won't create an error - java itself doesn't care if you follow these - but it improves readability and is strongly encouraged!

* make variable names meaningful - if it represents the number of apples, call it `numApples`, if it represents the player's height, call it `playerHeight`. It should almost read like natural language when you read it. "If the number of apples is more than 4" becomes. `if (numApples > 4)`.
* If your variable has multiple words, use Camel Case, where the first word starts with a lowercase letter and every subsequent word is uppercase. Avoid using underscores, even though they are allowed. Use `numApples`, not `NumApples`, or `numapples`, or `num_apples`.

* constants, variables that will never change, can be declared using the word "final" before the type, and then use all capital letters, like `final int PI=3.14159262;`

Be careful - once you name a variable, you have to use EXACTLY that name, including lowercase and uppercase, for the rest of the program!

## Basic data types in java

| General Type         | java-specific usage                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Boolean**              | `booleanÂ boolÂ =Â false;`                   | The value of a boolean is either `true` or `false`. These are most commonly used for comparison and decision-making.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Integer**              | `intÂ nÂ =Â 11;` or `longÂ n2Â =Â 32039403094;` | Holds a positive or negative whole integer (whole number). You would use the `long` type if you might need to hold values above 2 billion or so (or below negative 2 billion), but `int` is more common, as such large integers are rarely needed.                                                            |
| **Floating Point** value | `floatÂ fÂ =Â 1.230;` or `doubleÂ dÂ =Â 2.3;`   | Holds a decimal value, or a value in scientific notation. In this course we will usually use the `double` form as it is more accurate (but takes up more space). Because there is always rounding and therefore possible errors involved with decimal math, it is preferred to use integers when possible. |
| **Character**            | `charÂ cÂ =Â 'a';`                           | A *character* is a single piece of text data, ready to print to the screen, such as the character `'a'` or `'8'` or `'Ã¢'` or even `'ðŸ˜€'`. In java, a character (or `char`) literal is always surrounded by SINGLE quotes.                                                                                      |
| **String**               | `StringÂ sÂ =Â "abc";`                       | A *string* is a series of characters joined together. In java, we use the `String` type to hold these values (notice the capital, very important!) and we use double quotes to surround a string literal.                                                                                                     |



## Reference types vs. Primitive Types

To understand the difference between primitive and reference types, it helps to think about how variables actually work. When you run a program in java, it builds a special table in memory called a *Variable Lookup Table*. Imagine this looks like the table below:

| name | type   | size | value             | 
| ---- | ------ | ---- | ----------------- |
| `a`    | `int`    | 32   | `0010`... (32 bits) | 
| `b`    | `char`   | 16   | `1002`... (16 bits) | 
| `c`    | `String` | 64   | `1010`... (64 bits) | 

When you use a variable in your program, java goes to this table and says "hmmm, it looks like `a` is a 32-bit integer type, so lets interpret these 32 `0`'s and `1`'s as an integer."

With a **primitive type**, the value stored in the lookup table is the actual value of the variable. This works because primitive types always have the same, known size. Most of the types mentioned above are primitive, except `String`. 

For a **reference type**, though, like a `String`, the value stored in the table is an *address* to another spot in memory (called the heap). The heap is used to store more complicated pieces of data that may have lots of individual components, or be an unknown size. When java looks up `c`, it reads the address, then performs ANOTHER lookup to actually find the beginning of the actual `String` data. This allows you to work with the `String` in far more complex and powerful ways than when you work with the `int` data.

### Assigning values to variables and the String Lookup Table

When you use an equals sign to the right of a variable to set its value, that is called **assigning** a value to the variable. We can assign literals OR other variables of the same type. In all cases, the value of the assigned element is copied into the assignee.

```java
int numCookies = 3; 
// creates a new int called numCookies in the Variable Lookup Table,
// then copies the value 3 in the value spot

int numCakes = numCookies; 
// creates a new int numCakes, copies the value from numCookies to it

// The end result of these two is two different integer values in the table with
// the same value - 3 - but changes to one will not effect the other from now on.
``` 

`String`s specfically are so common and important that java actually creates a special thing called a String Lookup Table that allows us to save space by only creating a string value one time.

Consider the code below and read the comments to get a sense of how it works. Note that initializing `String`s with a literal is significantly more complex than with primitives like `int`, but assigning one variable to another is the same level of complexity!

```java
String firstName = "Douglas"; 
/* This starts the same - create a spot in the variable table called firstName, set its size and type.
 * But it gets really different after that because String's are special. 
 * First, this will use the String Lookup Table to see if there is already a string in the heap 
 * that has the value "Douglas".
 * If there is, it will copy the address of that string into the value of the table. 
 * If there isn't, it will create a new string in the heap with that value and 
 * copy the address into the table.
 */

String middleName = "Douglas";
/* This will follow the same steps as for firstName, but since it finds "Douglas" in the String table, 
 * it will assign the same address to middleName as firstName
 */

String lastName = firstName;
/* creates a spot in the variable table called lastName
 * and copies the value from firstName to lastName.
 * Notice that the 'variable = variable' form works EXACTLY the same for strings as integers,
 * but what is copied is the address, not the value!
 * Strings are only special when String *primitives* are involved.
 */

/* The end result of this is that all three variables - firstname, middleName, lastName -
 * all have the same value in the variable lookup table - the address of a spot in the heap
 * where a string with that value is stored. They are three names for the same thing!
 */
```

   String
   </details>
   
3. The following java code gives an error. Why?

   ```java
   String j;

   <details markdown="1"><summary>Answer</summary>
   `j` is a String but you are trying to assign it an integer 
   </details>

4. The following java code gives an error. Why?

    ```java
    int j;
    j = "123";
    ```

    <details markdown="1"><summary>Answer</summary>
    j is an integer, but you are assigning it a string.
    </details>

5. The following code gives an error. Why?
   
   ```java
   int numCookies = 3;
   //eat one cookie...
   int numCookies = 2;
   ```

   <details markdown="1"><summary>Answer</summary>
   the first line declares numCookies by using the type `int`. It cannot be declared again. This programmer could drop the keyword `int` and simply do `numCookies = 2;` on the third line to avoid the error.
   </details>

6. The following code gives an error. Why?
   
   ```java
   string theWord="cookie";
   ```

   <details markdown="1"><summary>Answer</summary>
   There is no type `string` - you need to capitalize it to make a `String`!
   </details>
