# Connections between classes and UML diagrams

It is very common in paper 2 of the IB CS exam to be asked to create *UML diagrams* of object clases. In these notes, we will learn how to do that.

## A simple example - one class

<table style="margin-left:2em;vertical-align:top"><tbody style="width:100%"><tr style="width:100%">
<td markdown="1" style="vertical-align:top">

### Code
{: style="text-align:center"}

```java
class Snowflake {
    private int speed = 1;
    private String color = "white";

    private double x;
    private double y;
    private double size;

    // pretend the Snowflake() constructor is here

    public void moveFlake() {
        this.y += this.speed;
    }
    public void increaseSize(double amount) {
        this.size += amount;
    }
   
    private boolean offScreen() {
        return (y < 0  || y > height);
    }
}
```
{: style="margin-left:0"}

</td>
<td markdown="1" style="vertical-align:top">

### Diagram
{: style="text-align:center"}

</td>
</tr></tbody></table>

The diagram contains four important parts:

1. The name of the class at the top
2. The instance variables and their types, listed Typescript-style
3. The methods, with parameters and return type if not void
4. The `+` and `-` signs tell whether each element is private (`-`) or public (`+`)

This diagram describes all of the important features of the class without taking up nearly as much space as the full code, and is easier to interpret. Note that the constructor is NOT included - since every class includes a constructor, that wouldn't provide any useful information.

## A more complicated example - multiple connected classes.

![Flight class diagram](../resources/media/flight%20class%20diagram%20example.svg){: style="width:100%"}

This UML diagram is made for the language TypeScript rather than java, but they are very similar. The image above shows three classes that are interconnected. Here are some things to notice:

1. In all three classes, all of the instance variables are private. In java, it is almost ALWAYS true - instance variables are private, and methods are provided to change them if need be. We will talk more about this later.
2. There are probably properties and methods that are not shown. It is not always required to show ALL of the instance variables and methods in large classes, just the most important ones to give an idea of how the class works.
3. The arrows connecting them show a relationship. Notice the text on each side of the arrow. It shows how many of the nearby objects you could expect to see in a relationship. `0..n` means "0 or more". So you expect 2 or more employees for each flight, but only one airplane for each flight. However, an airplane can be associated with many future flights, or as few as none (perhaps if it is under maintenance). The arrows do not show you how the relationship is IMPLEMENTED, only that the relationship exists.
