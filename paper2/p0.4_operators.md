# Arithmetic Operators and Assignment

An **operator**:star:, in a programming language, is a tool used to modify, manipulate, or work with individual values or variables. It is almost always represented using some form of *word* or *symbol* put before, after, or between one or more variables, constants, or literals.

Modern programming languages have MANY operators. We will define the most important ones below - a lot of them will seem obvious, but having the reference could be valuable.

I have bolded the ones that might have something kind of surprising or that you might not have seen before - if you only read a few of them, read those!

## Operators on Numeric Values

### Arithmetic Operators

The operators you are most familar with: these do math.

The examples below represent the results from java. The final column shows the symbol used for this operator in IB Pseudocode (more on that later!)

| Operator                                       | Code Sample                                  | Result                                                 | IB    |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----- |
| Addition (`+`)                                 | `int a = 2;int b = 7;`<br>`a + b`           | <br>`9`                                                |`+`|   
| Subtraction (`-`)                              | `a - b`                                      | `-5`                                                   | `-`   |
| Multiplication (`*`)                           | `a * b`                                      | `14`                                                   | `*`   |
| **Integer Division (`/`)**                               | `a / b` <br> `b / a`                         | `0`<br>`3`                          | `div`   |
| **Modulus or Remainder (`%`)**                 | `a % b`<br>`b % a`                           | `2` (remainder of 2 / 7) <br> `1` (remainder of 7 / 2) | `mod` |
| Floating point division (`/`)          | `double a = 2.0, b = 7.0`;<br> `a / b` <br> `b / a` | <br>`0.285714285714`<br>`3.5`                                         | `/` |
    
The arithmetic operators follow the standard mathematical order of operations - multiplication, modulus, and division are evluated left-to-right first, addition and subtraction second, but parentheses can be used to overcome the order.

A common error comes if you try to divide (or modulus) by 0. Be careful to check to make sure you aren't doing that if you ever divide by a variable!

## Operators on Strings

**Concatenation** is the process of combining two strings into one longer string.

| Operator                     | Code Sample                                 | Result          | IB  |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------- | --- |
| **Concatenation (`+`)** <br> | `String b = "bob"`;<br>`b + " " + b + "mary";` | <br>bob bobmary | N/A |

There are many other thing 

**Note that since the same operator, `+` is used for strings and numbers, you can get some odd results if you aren't careful.**

```java
"a" + 3; // result: "a3" - converts 3 to a string then concatentes
3 + "a"; // result: "3a" - same as above
3 + 2 + "a" // result: "5a" - does 3 + 2 first, then concatenates with a
3 + (2 + "a") // result: 32a. Concatenates 2 and a to "2a" then concatenates the 3.
"a" + 3 + 2 // result: a32
"a" + (3 + 2) // result: a5
"a" + (3 - 2) // result: a1
"a" + 3 - 2 // error! tries to do "a3" - 2, which is not possible.
```

## Check your Learning

1. At the end of the code block below, what will be printed?
   
   ```java
   int a = 7;
   int b = 3;
   a = a - b;
   b = a * a;
   a = a + 1;
   b = b - 1;
   System.out.println(a+b);
   ```

   String s = "23";
   int n = 43;
   System.out.println(s + n);

    double d2 = 5.0;
    int i1 = 1;
    int i2 = 4;
    System.out.println(i2 + i1 / i2);
    System.out.println(i2 - i1 % i2);

5.  Evaluate each expression

    1. `33 % 5 + 7 % 3; `     
    2. `50 / 2 / 2 * 2;`      
    3. `3 * 6 + 10 / 5 + 5;`  
    4. `50 / (2 / 2) % 2;`  
    5. `2 + 2 * 3;`           

    <details markdown="1"><summary>Click to expand answer</summary>
    a. `6 + 2` = **`8`**  
    b. `25 / 2 * 2` = `12 * 2` = **`24`**  
    c. `18 + 2 + 5` = **`20`**  
    d. `50 / 1 % 2` = `50 % 2` = **`0`**  
    e. `2 + 6` = **`8`**
