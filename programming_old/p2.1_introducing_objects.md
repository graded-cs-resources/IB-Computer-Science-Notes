# Introduction to Objects and Classes

Imagine you are writing a note-keeping app. You want to be able to use the app to create notes with different content and background colors.

One way to approach this would be using *arrays* (which we will study more later) as shown below:

```ts
String[] note_contents = ["This is my first note.","This is my second."];
String[] note_colors = ["red","blue"];
```

As long as you were careful to keep each array in the same order, it would be possible to add new notes by simply adding elements to both arrays, and then you could cycle through them. If you wanted to add an *action* to the notes, you could write functions like this.

This would work, but if you wanted to add an additional *property* to your note - for example, `date_created` or `due_date` - you'd need to add additinal arrays and keep track of even more things. This is where the idea of an *object* really starts to become useful and powerful.

## What is an object?

An **object**:star: is a way to organize the data in a program by its purpose and function. It is simply a collection of **properties**:star: (essentially variables) and **methods**:star: (behaviors) that are collected under one name. 

In some languages, such as javascript, you can make single, individual objects. For example, the following code makes a single object called `note1` in javascript:

```javascript
var note1 = {
    color: blue,
    contents: "Send Mr. Griswold an appreciative e-mail"
}
```

Most languages that allow us to create objects use a notation called **dot-notation**:star: to access the properties of an object. This allows you to type things in the form *`objectName.propertyname`* to work with the property. So for example, after running the javascript code above, you could write lines like:

```javascript
note1.color = "yellow"; //changes the color of note1 to yellow
alert(note1.contents); //makes a popup window with the contents of note1
```

java does not provide a built-in way to create SINGLE objects like this. Instead, java defines entire *clasess* of objects with related properties and behaviors.

## Classes

A **class**:star: is a DESCRIPTION of an object, a template or recipe that describes the overall shape and behavior of a type of object.[D.3.1](../unit0/syllabus.md#D31){: .syl} It describes what types of information we will hold about the object, what types of methods will be done to or by the object, and how to create a new **instance**:star:, or specific case, of the object.

When you define a class you are essentially creating your own data type. The class below defines a new object of type `Note`.

```java
class Note { //classes are, by convention, capitalized

  /*============== PROPERTIES / INSTANCE VARIABLES =======================*/
  // the word private is always used for instance variables in a class - more on why later!
  private String contents;
  private String color;
  private boolean complete;

  /*========= CONSTRUCTORS ====================*/
  // The constructors are special methods that define how to create a new
  // *instance* of an object. They are named after the class itself!
  // You can have more than one constructor, to make it possible to create the object
  // several different ways.

  Note(String theContents, String theColor) {
    contents = theContents;
    color = theColor;
  }

  Note() {
      contents = "Your note here.";
      color = "yellow";
  }

  /*=============METHODS===================*/
  // methods define the ACTIONS of the object.
  // we will mostly use public methods in this course, but more on that later!

 public boolean check_off() {
    complete = true;
  }

}

// we use the "new" command to call the constructor and get a new note
// every time the "new" command is called it creates a new object then runs the 
// constructor method on the object.
Note note1 = new Note("This is my first note", "red");
Note note2 = new Note("This is my second note", "blue");
Note note3 = new Note(); // this one will use the defaults color and message!
note2.check_off(); //note2 is now marked complete!
System.out.println("Note 1's color is: " + note1.color);

```

#### Check your understanding

1. Write an additional constructor for the `Note` class above that takes one string, the contents, and leaves the color as the default "yellow" value.

   ```java
   Note(String theContents) {
       contents = theContents;
       color = "yellow";
   }
   ```
   </details>

You now have three new notes! Even though they were all originally designed by the same class, once they are created, **instantiated**:star:, they are now independent items that can be adjusted and treated separately, as shown below.

7. Create a class for `Cookie` objects with three instance variables: `flavor` is a string, `size` is an integer, and `temperature` is a double. Include a constructor function to make a new `Cookie` by passing in all three variables

   ```java
   class Cookie {
      String flavor;
      int size;
      double temperature;

      Cookie(String theFlavor, int theSize, double theTemp) {
        flavor = theFlavor;
        size = theSize;
        temperature = theTemp;
       }
   }
   ```
