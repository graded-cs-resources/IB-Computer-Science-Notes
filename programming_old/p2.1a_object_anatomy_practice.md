# Object and Method writing practice problems

1.  Consider the class below. If you ran the code `Paupers p = new Paupers(5, -4); int r = p.divers(4, 2)`, then what would be the value of `r`, `p.myTrams` and `p.myWeekly`?

    ```java
    class Paupers
    {
        private int myTrams;
        private int myWeekly;

        public Paupers(int digest, int causes){
            if(causes == 0) causes = 2;
            myWeekly = digest % causes;
            myTrams = digest * causes;
        }
        public int divers(int crucial, int lockbox){
            crucial = crucial - lockbox;
            myTrams = myTrams + lockbox;
            return myTrams + crucial;
        }
    }
    ```

    The value of `r` would be `-16`, the value of `p.myTrams` would be `-18` and the value of `p.myWeekly` would be `1`.
    </details>

2. If you made an object from the class `Holdall` sending `-7` and `2` to the constructor, then sending `-7` and `2` to the method `tactics`, what value would the method `tactics` return? What would be the values of the instance variables?

    ```java
    public class Holdall
    {
        private int myBillowy, myBossism;

        public Holdall(int labored, int phonily){
            myBossism = labored - phonily;
            myBillowy = labored + phonily;
        }
        public int tactics(int ached, int slaters){
            ached = slaters + ached;
            if(myBossism == 0) myBossism = 3;
            slaters = myBillowy % myBossism;
            return myBossism;
        }
    }
    ```
    <details markdown="1"><summary>Click to expand answer</summary>
    The returned value is `-9`. The instance variable values are `-5` and `-9`.
    </details>



3.  Write a class named `Belated` that has two instance variables, a `String` named `myHypos` and an `int` named `myDroller`. Give the class a constructor method with a `String` parameter named `kopeks`, which provides an initial value to `myHypos`. Include a method named `locusts` within the class that would return the value of `myDroller` to a client.
    
    <details markdown="1"><summary>Click to expand answer</summary>
    ```java
    class Belated
    {
        private String myHypos;  
        private int myDroller;
        
        public Belated(String kopeks) {
            myHypos = kopeks;
        }

        public int locusts() {
            return myDroller;
        }
    }
    ```
    </details>

4. Write a class named `Curse` that has two instance variables, a `String` named `myMosses` and an `int` named `myMacula`. Give the class a constructor method with a string parameter named `thud`, which provides an initial value to `myMacula`. Include a method named `pronged` within the class that returns `myMosses`
    
    <details markdown="1"><summary>Click to expand answer</summary>
    ```java
    class Curse
    {
        private String myMosses;  
        private int myMacula;
        
        public Curse(int thud) {
            myMacula = thud;
        }

        public String pronged() {
            return myMosses;
        }
    }
    ```
    </details>

5. Write a class called `Bobbies` that has one private instance variable, `jo`, with an initial value of "what?" and an empty constructor. Add a method named `merles` that accepts formal parameters `wagging` and `reaching` as ints, finds their sum, stores the result in a local variable call `verbs` then returns the value of `verbs`.
   
   <details markdown="1"><summary>Click to expand answer</summary>
   ```java
   class Bobbies {
       private String jo = "what?";

       public Bobbies() {}

       public int merles(int wagging, int reading) {
           int verbs = wagging + reading;
           return verbs;
       }
   }
   ```
   </details>

6.  Which expression has been evaluated correctly?

    1. `e = 50 / (2 / 2) % 2;` //e = 25
    2. `c = 33 % 5 + 7 % 3;` //c = 4
    3. `a = 2 + 2 * 3;` //a = 12
    4. `b = 3 * 6 + 10 / 5 + 5;` //b = 10
    5. `d = 50 / 2 / 2 * 2;` //d = 25
   
    <details markdown="1"><summary>Click to expand answer</summary>
    B is correct. You should be able to evaluate all of these.
    </details>

7.  Consider the class below:
   
    ```java
    class Dog {
        private String breed;
        private String name;
        private float weight;

        public Dog(/*code missing */) {
            /* code missing */
        }

        public String sound() {
            return "bark!";
        }

        public String speak() {
            return name + " says " + Dog.sound();
        }

        public void eat(float amount) {
            /* code missing */
        }
    }
  
    ```
    1.  Identify the instance variables.

        <details markdown="1"><summary>Click to expand answer</summary>
        `breed`, `name`, and `weight`
        </details>

    2.  Complete the constructor code so that it sets all instance variables.

        <details markdown="1"><summary>Click to expand answer</summary>
        ```java
        public Dog(String thebreed, String thename, float theweight) {
            breed = thebreed;
            name = thename;
            weight = theweight;
        }
        ```
        </details>
    
    3.  Write code to create two new dogs of your choice, then make one of them speak. Predict the return output of your dog speaking.

        <details markdown="1"><summary>Click to expand answer</summary>
        ```java
        Dog rover = new Dog("dachsund", "Rover",8.2);
        Dog django = new Dog("mutt", "Django", 21.3);
        django.speak() // output will be "Django says bark!"
        ```
        </details>

    4.  Implement the code for the `eat()` method, which should increase dog's weight by the amount it eats (we will not implement a `poop()` method, its reverse.)

        <details markdown="1"><summary>Click to expand answer</summary>
        ```java
        public void eat(float amount) {
            weight += amount;
        }
        ```
        </details>
